	abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate {(FWER).} This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the {FWER} when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the {FWER} is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

	abstract = {Contemporary treatment of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia {(AML)} requires the assignment of patients to specific risk groups. To explore whether expression profiling of leukemic blasts could accurately distinguish between the known risk groups of {AML,} we analyzed 130 pediatric and 20 adult {AML} diagnostic bone marrow or peripheral blood samples using the Affymetrix {U133A} microarray. Class discriminating genes were identified for each of the major prognostic subtypes of pediatric {AML,} including {t(15;17)[PML-RAR{alpha}],} {t(8;21)[AML1-ETO],} inv16 {[CBF{beta}-MYH11],} {MLL} chimeric fusion genes, and cases classified as {FAB-M7.} When subsets of these genes were used in supervised learning algorithms, an overall classification accuracy of more than 93\% was achieved. Moreover, we were able to use the expression signatures generated from the pediatric samples to accurately classify adult de novo {AMLs} with the same genetic lesions. The class discriminating genes also provided novel insights into the molecular pathobiology of these leukemias. Finally, using a combined pediatric data set of 130 {AMLs} and 137 acute lymphoblastic leukemias, we identified an expression signature for cases with {MLL} chimeric fusion genes irrespective of lineage. Surprisingly, {AMLs} containing partial tandem duplications of {MLL} failed to cluster with {MLL} chimeric fusion gene cases, suggesting a significant difference in their underlying mechanism of transformation.},
