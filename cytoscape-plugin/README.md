Cytoscape Plugin
================

A simple Cytoscape plugin that can be used as a basis for implementation of
more complex ones.

Network Failure Assignment
--------------------------

Failure points of a network are special nodes that if removed split the network 
into two or more separated sub-networks. These are important points in protein-
protein interaction networks (as well as in all biological networks) as they can 
be the first place to look at if we are interested to affect only specific 
pathways of a network (think of drug design for example).

In this assignment you will be required to write a Cytoscape plugin. You will 
have to submit the .jar archive as well as the source code and a detailed 
documentation of the software. Finally you will have to apply your code to some 
real data that and write a report of the results.
